# Windows Terminal with Git Bash

This repository contains files for setting up the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) together with the [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com).

Additionally, some Bash and Git dotfiles are supplied (`.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.bash_prompt`, â€¦) based on [Okeanos/dotfiles](https://github.com/Okeanos/dotfiles) (originally forked from [mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)).

## KeePassXC as SSH Agent
The Windows enabled OpenSSH client make using [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) as an SSH agent to manage SSH keys on Windows within the Git Bash possible.
Enable the OpenSSH Agent via the Services management interface by setting the `OpenSSH Authentication Agent` to `automatic` and starting it.

Within KeePassXC the SSH support has to be enabled in the KeePassXC settings along with the option to use OpenSSH instead of Pageant.

## Environment:

Set the following `User Environment Variables`

- `HOME` : `%UserProfile%` (this will prevent Git Bash supplied tools from arbitrarily deciding on their own where `~/` is)

## Installation
Follow the installation instructions for:

- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com)
  - Check the box for the Windows Terminal Fragment
  - If prompted, select externally supplied SSH
  - When prompted use the Windows Secure Channel library instead of the bundled certficates
- [KeePassXC](https://keepass.info)

In addition to that individual SSH keys within the KeePass vault have to be enabled and/or loaded manually into the SSH agent.

- Place the `.git*` files into your home directory
- Place the `.bash*` files into your home directory
- Place the `config.d` folder contents into `%UserProfile%\.ssh\config.d` along with its contents

Create a new file called `90-user` and place it into `%UserProfile%\.ssh\config.d\90-user` with the following contents:

```
Host *
	User <your account>
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

```

Please make sure to have an empty new line at the end.

To add new SSH configurations just create files as necessary in the `~/.ssh/config.d` that contain the necessary configuration ending with an empty new line line each. To make sure a valid SSH configuration can be created from that the order of files is important, i.e. your custom host configurations should be alphabetically between the `00-base` and the `90-user` files. You have to delete the `~/.ssh/config` file after each change to a host and reload the `.bashrc` file to make the changes available.

## Git Bash specifics

**This only applies until the following Git for Windows pull request is merged: [#367](https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/pull/367).**

With Git Bash the bundled OpenSSH binaries will be used by default and not talk to the now enabled Windows OpenSSH agent. So, once the Windows OpenSSH agent is enabled, you can safely delete the Git bundled OpenSSH binaries as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview) to make it use the Windows ones instead.

Do not delete `%ProgramFiles%\Git\usr\bin\ssh-copy-id`, though, as there is no Windows supplied alternative.

```
%ProgramFiles%\Git\usr\bin\scp.exe
%ProgramFiles%\Git\usr\bin\sftp.exe
%ProgramFiles%\Git\usr\bin\ssh-add.exe
%ProgramFiles%\Git\usr\bin\ssh-agent.exe
%ProgramFiles%\Git\usr\bin\ssh-keygen.exe
