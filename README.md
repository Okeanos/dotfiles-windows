# Okeanosâ€™ dotfiles

![Screenshot of my shell prompt](screenshot.png)

This is a Windows port of [my dotfiles](https://github.com/Okeanos/dotfiles) for macOS.

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you donâ€™t want or need. Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

**Note:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is installed as part of the setup. Because it [defaults to the WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) you make sure to install that before everything else.

### Docker & Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2)

You have to manually install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (WSL 2) because it requires a restart of the system and some manual invervention.

**Note**: Enabling WSL 2 means that software such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) or [VMWare Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) no longer works as expected. Windows only allows a single hypervisor at a time and WSL 2 is Hyper-V based and prevents running VirtualBox/VMWare Workstation. Workarounds for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html#hyperv-support) and [VMWare](https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2020/05/vmware-workstation-now-supports-hyper-v-mode.html) exist, however, suffer from [extreme](https://communities.vmware.com/t5/VMware-Workstation-Pro/Huge-performance-drop-after-upgrading-to-VMware-Workstation-Pro/td-p/2888831) [performance](https://communities.vmware.com/t5/VMware-Workstation-Player/Huge-performance-drop-of-VMWare-Player-guest-running-on-Windows/td-p/2808460) [penalties](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html#hyperv-support).

If you want a custom WSL 2 instance (different from the Docker backend) check the available distributions and install one:

```powershell
wsl --list --online
wsl --install --distribution Ubuntu-22.04
```

### Getting Started

1. Manually download [`winget.ps1`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Okeanos/dotfiles-windows/main/winget.ps1) and all other `winget_*` files into the same location
1. Update the `winget.ps1` to only install software you actually want
1. Go through the `winget_*` files and modify them as necessary because they will be used to source the installation options for e.g. Git to allow unattended installation.
1. Execute `winget.ps1` from your PowerShell (may need elevated permissions)
1. You can now clone the repository wherever you want (I like to keep it in `%UserProfile%\Workspace\dotfiles`)
1. You can now `bootstrap.ps1` your system
1. **Optionally** and **after a careful review** you can now run `windows.ps1`

If you decide not to run the `windows.ps1` script please make sure to set the following `User Environment Variables` in Windows:

- `HOME` : `%UserProfile%` (this will prevent Git Bash supplied tools from arbitrarily deciding on their own where `~`, i.e. `${HOME}` is)

#### Installing Software (`winget.ps1`)

When setting up a new PC, you need to install some common [Windows Packages](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) (after making sure that `winget` is installed, of course) for this repository to work as expected:

```powershell
.\winget.ps1
```

Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on packages installed by `winget.ps1`. If you donâ€™t plan to use `winget`, you should look carefully through the `winget.ps1` and related config files and manually install any particularly important tools manually. Good examples of these are Windows Terminal and Git Bash.

##### Manual Installation Caveats

Follow the installation instructions for the following software and take note of the caveats below:

- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com)
	- **Select Components**
		- Uncheck the box for the Windows Explorer Integration (it doesn't work with Windows Terminal integration)
		- Check the box for the Windows Terminal Fragment
	- When prompted use the Windows Secure Channel library instead of the bundled certficates (allows using the Windows certificate store for system-wide same behavior when it comes to self-signed certificates)
	- When prompted select "checkout as-is, commit as-is" (less magic and tools can be correctly configured to use Unix style line endings nowadays)
- A password manager, either:
	- [KeePass](https://keepass.info)
		- [KeeAgent](https://github.com/dlech/KeeAgent) for SSH support (supports Windows native OpenSSH & Git Bash bundled OpenSSH in parallel)
	- [KeePassXC](https://keepass.info) (built in SSH Agent Support, different from KeeAgent; only supports Windows native OpenSSH)
		- [Chrome/Chromium Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepassxc-browser/oboonakemofpalcgghocfoadofidjkkk)
		- [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/)
	- [1Password]()
		- [SSH Agent Setup](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/)
- An advanced text editor (lightweight IDE), such as â€“ make sure that [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) support is installed and enabled:
	- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com))
	- [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)

Once you installed all of this and configured the software to your liking you can now clone the repository wherever you want (I like to keep it in `%UserProfile%/Workspace/dotfiles`). Afterwards you can run the bootstrapper from your PowerShell as described below.

### The bootstrap script (`bootstrap.ps1`)

The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder. Run it from your Powershell.

```powershell
cd "$($ENV:UserProfile)\Workspace\dotfiles" ; .\bootstrap.ps1
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then run bootstrapper again:

```powershell
cd "$($ENV:UserProfile)\Workspace\dotfiles" ; .\bootstrap.ps1
```

#### Java Installation

The [Maven Toolchains](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html) file assumes that the [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net) Java versions are used. Additionally, the target folder has to be modified during the installation to remove any patch and minor version information, i.e.:

`C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.1.12-hotspot` becomes `C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\temurin-17.jdk` (in line with macOS and Linux naming schemes)

This has to be done explictly (see [adoptium/installer#422](https://github.com/adoptium/installer/issues/422) for details) but can be automated as shown in `winget.ps1`.

#### Sensible Windows defaults (`windows.ps1`)

When setting up a new PC, you may want to set some sensible Windows defaults. Please note that you really ought to read the contents of the `windows.ps1` script very, very carefully because it changes a large number of system settings. You can apply it by invoking it like this:

```powershell
cd "$($ENV:UserProfile)\Workspace\dotfiles" ; .\windows.ps1
```

## Modifying the `$PATH`

Please note that the standard dotfiles already modify your Git Bash path in two ways:

- They add `/c/Windows/System32/OpenSSH` to force all programs to use the Windows supplied version of OpenSSH (to make it compatible with KeePassXC by default)
- They add `$HOME/bin` as a place where you can put binaries such as [`jq`](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) to make them easily accessible

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-L26)) takes place.

Hereâ€™s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you donâ€™t want to commit to a public repository.

An example of `~/.extra` by the original author of this repository looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Foo Bar"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="foo.bar@example.org"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. Itâ€™s probably better to [fork this repository](https://github.com/Okeanos/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.

## Unlinking / Uninstalling

If you want to unlink (uninstall) all dotfiles managed by this repository you can use the `unlink.sh` script. This operation is non-destructive and will only remove the symlinks from your `%UserProfile%` directory. Any customizations, e.g. `.extra` or `.gituser`, that were created by you will stay in `%UserProfile%`. You can restore the dotfiles again by running `bootstrap.ps1`.

```powershell
cd "$($ENV:UserProfile)\Workspace\dotfiles" ; .\unlink.ps1
```

If you want to unlink particular dotfiles (e.g. for `vim`) you'll have to manually delete the files from your `%UserProfile%` directory because there is no [`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for Windows ðŸ˜•.
