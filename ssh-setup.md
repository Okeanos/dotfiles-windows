# SSH Setup

There are multiple, incompatible competing options for useful/working Windows SSH setups.

Windows Subsystem for Linux is not covered here (beyond [a small section](#windows-openssh-in-wsl-and-wsl-2)) and
depending on the version you prefer (WSL1 or WSL2) you may run into various different problems with the options
described below.

## KeePass with KeeAgent or KeePassXC

There are two options for FOSS based solutions around the [KeePass](https://keepass.info) password manager family
available. One relies on Windows native OpenSSH fully (with its own caveats) and the other is a little more flexible but
experimental and has other drawbacks such as no official browser support via the password manager.

### KeePass with KeeAgent as SSH Agent

[KeeAgent](https://github.com/dlech/KeeAgent) is incompatible with the Windows OpenSSH _agent_ because it supplies its
own SSH agent. However, [KeeAgent](https://github.com/dlech/KeeAgent) is able to talk to both Windows OpenSSH and the
Git Bash bundled OpenSSH version after configuring the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.

1. Install [KeePass](https://keepass.info) and the [KeeAgent](https://github.com/dlech/KeeAgent) plugin.
2. In KeePass > Tools > Options configure the KeeAgent plugin:
    - Enable agent for Windows OpenSSH (experimental)
    - Create a Cygwin compatible socket file with the path `%UserProfile%\.ssh\cygwin.socket`
    - Create a msysGit compatible socket file with the path `%UserProfile%\.ssh\msysgit.socket`
3. In `%UserProfile%/.exports` toggle the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` variable (Cygwin should be fine), i.e.
  add `export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/.ssh/cygwin.socket` to your `%UserProfile%\.bashrc` or `%UserProfile%\.bash_profile` file

Optionally, remove the `/c/Windows/System32/OpenSSH`-prefix from `%UserProfile%/.config/bash/path` to use Windows
OpenSSH in PowerShell and Git Bash bundled OpenSSH in Git Bash.

### KeePassXC with external SSH Agent

Windows ships its own OpenSSH binaries starting with Windows 10. See the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation)
for more details.

For this to work in Git Bash as expected as well, the `$PATH` has to be prefixed with the Windows OpenSSH binaries or
else Git Bash will prefer its bundled OpenSSH version that is incapable of talking to the Windows OpenSSH agent. These
dotfiles supply a `$PATH` already containing the correct path modifications (see `%UserProfile%/.config/bash/path`).

The Windows OpenSSH client makes using [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) to manage SSH keys on Windows within the Git
Bash possible.
Enable the OpenSSH Agent via the Windows Services management interface by setting the `OpenSSH Authentication Agent`
to `automatic` and starting it or alternatively via a PowerShell prompt with administrative permissions:

```powershell
# By default the ssh-agent service is disabled. Allow it to be manually started for the next step to work.
# Make sure you're running as an Administrator.
Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic

# Start the service
Start-Service ssh-agent

# This should return a status of Running
Get-Service ssh-agent
```

Within KeePassXC the SSH support has to be enabled in the KeePassXC settings along with the option to use OpenSSH
instead of Pageant.

### Caveats

Windows OpenSSH has a number of unsolved (despite claims to the contrary in some cases) issues that make it unreliable
bordering on unusable in some instances:

- [Early EOF errors when running git fetch over ssh](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1322) (
  2022-10-08)
- [Support SSH_AUTH_SOCK Unix Domain Sockets for Windows](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1761) (
  2022-10-08)
  - There is a [PR#674](https://github.com/PowerShell/openssh-portable/pull/674) that attempts to address this and may
    solve the Git Bash integration woes.
- Windows OpenSSH is a system package and not regularly updated (Windows 10 21H2 shipping OpenSSH_for_Windows_8.1p1,
  LibreSSL 3.0.2) (2022-10-08)
  - [Win32-OpenSSH update in Windows](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1693)
  - it may be feasible to replace the default package
    via [winget](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1896) &
    [OpenSSH Version Directory](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/OpenSSH),
    though

That means that while KeePassXC may be generally preferable because of its superior Browser integration (or other
subjective reasons) the SSH integration on Windows is subpar and likely going to frustrate you at times. There is an
open KeePassXC issue asking to [support MSYS2 ssh-agent sockets on Windows](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/4681)
(unresolved by 2023-02-13) that would improve the situation.

The [OmniSSHAgent](https://github.com/masahide/OmniSSHAgent) project appears to solve some of the cross provider and
consumer issues by providing the required interfaces to interact with Git Bash provided SSH (`cygwin`/`MSYS2`) and
Windows OpenSSH as well as the ability to provide SSH keys via KeePassXC. I haven't tested it though.

## 1Password

A commercial software alternative is [1Password](https://1password.com) that has built in SSH support starting with
version 8.

Please check the [official documentation](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/) for details. At this time
(2023-02-13) this requires [Windows Hello](https://support.1password.com/windows-hello/):

> **Requirements**
> â€¦
> Microsoft OpenSSH
> [Windows Hello](https://support.1password.com/windows-hello/) must be configured to unlock 1Password

## PuTTY and Pageant

A long-time favorite and previous de facto solution on Windows for enabling SSH is
[PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) with Pageant. KeePass with KeeAgent and KeePassXC both
support Pageant and Git-Bash may also be able to consume SSH keys offered via Pageant managed in KeePass(XC). I have
never used this, though.

### PuttY and Pageant with Git Commit Signing

Ensure the integration is set up as expected using [ssh-pageant](https://gitforwindows.org/openssh-integration-with-pageant.html).

## BitWarden

[BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com) is a freemium solution similar to 1Password and [does](https://bitwarden.com/help/ssh-agent/)
offer SSH Agent integration as well (version 2025.1.2 or newer).

## Windows OpenSSH in WSL and WSL 2

Preface: I have no experience with this making OpenSSH keys available in WSL 1 or 2 from Windows hosts.

There's [OmniSSHAgent](https://github.com/masahide/OmniSSHAgent) as previously pointed out. This appears to solve many
of the integration issues between various consumers of SSH keys and providers thereof. I haven't tested it, though.

Beyond that there some additional options for this that may or may not work based on arcane invocations of shell
scripts, explore on your own.
You may run into weird issues, though, because generally OpenSSH and OpenSSH Agent versions have to match and the WSL (1
and 2) OpenSSH binaries are updated and maintained separately from Windows.

You may want to take a look at [wsl-agent-bridge](https://github.com/reynoldsbd/wsl-agent-bridge) and [wsl-ssh-pageant](https://github.com/benpye/wsl-ssh-pageant)
or [Sharing SSH keys between Windows and WSL 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/sharing-ssh-keys-between-windows-and-wsl-2/).

### npiperelay for WLS 2

Using [jstarks/npiperelay](https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay) you can forward the Windows OpenSSH agent into e.g.
WSL 2. In particular [PR#12](https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay/pull/12) may be of interest.

### WSL SSH Agent for WSL 1

Using [rupor-github/wsl-ssh-agent](https://github.com/rupor-github/wsl-ssh-agent) you can forward the Windows OpenSSH
into WSL 1.

## None of the above

Really? Well, that works, too. Whatever floats your boat: Manual (or semi-manual) setup it is.

Please read what GitHub has to say on the matter in
[their documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases#auto-launching-ssh-agent-on-git-for-windows).
