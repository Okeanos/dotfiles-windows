# The following things are examples of fancy stuff you can do in your ssh config
# Consult the manual for more details on configuration parameters: https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config
# See also https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32486031 and in particular https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32493422 for additional tips

# Use rsync (only works if the remote supports it of course to copy the local user vim config to remote on connect); this requires you disable the LocalCommand during rsync/scp to prevent infinite loops
# See also https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32468605 for a more elaborate example
#Host example.org
#	PermitLocalCommand yes
#	LocalCommand rsync "ssh -o PermitLocalCommand=no" %d/.vimrc %r@%n:~

# Alternatively you can use scp to do the same (same infinite loop caveat applies)
#Host example.org
#	PermitLocalCommand yes
#	LocalCommand scp -o PermitLocalCommand=no %d/.vimrc %r@%n:~/.

# Prevent TOFU and related problems with the known hosts file for example on localhost (be careful with it!)
#Host *
#	NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes

# Alternatively, for older OpenSSH versions this should work as well:
#Host localhost
#	UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
#	StrictHostKeyChecking no

# Make SSH auto-default to a particular Domain (.local here) if none is provided: `ssh user@pi` will result in a connection attempt to `ssh user@pi.local`
#Host *
#	CanonicalizeHostName yes
#	CanonicalizeFallbackLocal yes
#	CanonicalDomains local

# Jump through various hosts to reach a destination
#Host jump.example.org
#	HostName example.org
#Host extra-jump.example.com
#	HostName example.org
#Host *.example.org !jump.example.org
#	ProxyJump jump.example.org
#Host *.example.com !extra-jump.example.com
#	ProxyJump jump.example.org,extra-jump.example.com
